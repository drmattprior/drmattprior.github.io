Miscarriage is the commonest complication in pregnancy. One in four pregnancies ends this way. The physical experience can be awful in itself, but in the words of a patient, "the grief of miscarriage can last forever."

The commonest question for women who have experienced miscarriage is simple--why did it happen? The answer is rarely apparent.

Many so-called "treatments" to prevent miscarriage are unproven. But recent research suggests some miscarriages may be prevented with progesterone.

In this talk for clinicians, I explored the most recent evidence.
