If you’re hoping to get pregnant, you might wonder about your fertility and whether you can improve it. Some factors might be beyond your control, such as medical issues that affect the ability to conceive. But your lifestyle choices can have an effect on your fertility, too.

The UK Chief Medical Officers’ (CMO) guidance is that: If you are pregnant or think you could become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum [1](https://bigfertilityproject.com/alcohol-fertility-and-ivf/#fn1-3869 "see footnote"). But what is the research to support this claim?

A large amount of evidence shows that drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk. Nevertheless, fewer data on the effects of alcohol consumption on fertility exist.

Drinking alcohol within the recommended limit of 14 units per week has not been shown to decrease fertility. The time it takes to conceive is exactly the same as for non-drinkers. However, in couples where the male partner drinks heavily, over 20 units per week take significantly longer to get pregnant [2](https://bigfertilityproject.com/alcohol-fertility-and-ivf/#fn2-3869 "see footnote").

### Alcohol and IVF

The largest study of effect of alcohol on IVF treatment looked at over 4700 IVF cycles in more than 2500 couples. Researchers found that for men or women undergoing IVF, drinking four or more drinks per week is associated with a higher risk of failed fertilisation and a 21 percent lower chance of having a baby [3](https://bigfertilityproject.com/alcohol-fertility-and-ivf/#fn3-3869 "see footnote").

Going into an IVF cycle with a positive mindset can help emotionally when going through treatment. Patients often want to look back and feel as though they did everything possible to try and have a baby. Alcohol shouldn’t be considered in isolation. Other lifestyle factors such as smoking, caffeine, diet and exercise are all important for general wellbeing an health.

Making subtle lifestyle changes is unlikely to play a significant role in the chances of IVF being successful. Drinking in moderation does not seem to affect fertility or IVF outcome. So, you don’t need to be hard on yourself, or your partner if you have the occasional tipple.

## Drinks and units

A 750ml bottle of red, white or rosé wine (ABV 13.5%) contains 10 units.
