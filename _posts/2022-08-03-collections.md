Keeping up to date with academic literature is really difficult. On average, a new paper is published every 20 minutes.

I've never been a believer in textbooks. They are out of date before they're even published and cost too much money. Instead, I prefer to find information in high-quality review articles.

Here I've collected by topic, some useful papers that I frequently refer to.
