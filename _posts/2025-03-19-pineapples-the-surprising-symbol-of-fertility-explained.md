You only need to scroll Instagram fertility feeds for a few moment before encountering a pineapple. Patients, and clinicians (myself included) sometimes wear pineapple socks and [IVFbabble](https://www.ivfbabble.com/) used a popular pineapple pin badge to promote their campaign.

But why have pineapples become synonymous with fertility?

Here are a few reasons we have been able to uncover:

1. **Symbolism:** Pineapples have historically been used as a symbol of hospitality and welcome. In the 17th and 18th centuries, pineapples were rare and expensive, so they became a symbol of wealth and status. When a host served a pineapple, it was a sign that the guest was important and welcome. Over time, the symbolism of the pineapple expanded to include the idea of abundance and prosperity, which are qualities that are often associated with fertility. 
2. **Nutritional benefits:** Pineapples are rich in nutrients that are important for fertility, such as vitamin C, manganese, and bromelain. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps protect sperm from damage, while manganese is important for healthy hormone production. Bromelain is an enzyme that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and may help improve blood flow to the uterus, which can be beneficial for fertility. 
3. **Cultural beliefs:** In some cultures, pineapples are believed to have aphrodisiac properties that can enhance fertility. For example, in some parts of Asia, pineapples are traditionally given as a wedding gift to symbolise fertility and good luck. Additionally, some traditional medicine practitioners use pineapples as a natural remedy for infertility. 

Due to these reasons, pineapples have become a popular symbol in fertility campaigns, particularly those focused on natural or holistic approaches to fertility.

However, it’s important to note that while pineapples can be a healthy addition to a fertility-friendly diet, there is no conclusive evidence that they can directly improve fertility or IVF outcomes.
