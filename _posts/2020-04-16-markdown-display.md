Who likes Microsoft Word? I can't stand it. Documents look a mess, styles get all mixed up, and it is way too easy to get distracted from actually doing any work.

I much prefer to write using Markdown. Markdown is a simple way of writing using a plain text editor to remove the distractions of styles. This document is written in Markdown, and the original can be viewed on [GitHub][1], so you can see how it works.

The rest of this article shows the styling applied to Markdown.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

The final element.
