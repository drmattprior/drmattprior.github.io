The saying "You are what you eat" emphasises the idea that the food and nutrients we consume directly influence our overall health, well-being, and even our physical and mental attributes.  Therefore, surely our diet must have an impact on our fertility  and ability to nourish a pregnancy.

The relationship between diet and fertility has gained substantial attention in recent years. While medical advancements in IVF play a role in assisting people with fertility challenges, success rate have not significantly changed. So patients sensibly ask, is there anything I can do to improve my chances? 

Basic research shows that certain nutrients influence reproductive health. From the quality of eggs and sperm to hormonal balance. This growing understanding has sparked a wave of exploration into various dietary patterns, and supplements which may affect and improve these pathways.

Many have sought to promote diets and supplements that apparently boost fertility. Books such as 'Eat Yourself Pregnant' and 'The IVF Diet' are bestsellers, but what is the evidence to support changing your diet. Surprisingly, very little.

Recent studies looking at the Mediterranean diet have been more promising. In this article, we'll explore the connection between the Mediterranean diet and fertility, including IVF success. You can then decide whether it's worth trying this diet to enhance your chances of conceiving.

## What is the Mediterranean Diet? 
The Mediterranean diet is not just a diet; it's a lifestyle that is inspired by the traditional eating patterns of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It's characterised by a rich consumption of whole foods, emphasising fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats like olive oil. This diet is renowned for its numerous health benefits, including improved heart health, weight management, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer.

**The Mediterranean Diet and Fertility**
Recent research has turned its attention to the potential link between the Mediterranean diet and fertility, particularly its role in enhancing IVF outcomes. While the exact mechanisms are still being explored, several factors within the Mediterranean diet appear to positively influence reproductive health.

1. **Antioxidant-Rich Foods:** The Mediterranean diet is abundant in fruits and vegetables, which are rich sources of antioxidants. These compounds play a vital role in protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress, a factor that can impact egg and sperm quality.

2. **Healthy Fats:** Olive oil, a staple of the Mediterranean diet, is rich in monounsaturated fats and polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory properties. A balanced intake of healthy fats may contribute to hormone balance and reproductive health.

3. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Found in fatty fish like salmon and nuts, omega-3 fatty acids are known to support reproductive health by promoting blood flow, reducing inflammation, and aiding in hormone production.

4. **Fibre and Nutrients:** Whole grains and legumes in the Mediterranean diet provide ample fibre and essential nutrients like folate and vitamin B6. These nutrients are crucial for hormonal balance and overall reproductive function.

##  Scientific Evidence
A study published in the journal *Human Reproduction* in 2018 indicated that women who adhered to a Mediterranean diet in the six months leading up to IVF treatment had a higher likelihood of achieving a successful pregnancy and live birth. This study followed over 240 women and found that those who closely followed the Mediterranean diet had a 65-68% higher likelihood of successful IVF outcomes compared to those who did not adhere to the diet.

## Conclusion
While the journey through IVF can be complex and emotionally challenging, emerging research suggests that the Mediterranean diet may offer a promising avenue to enhance IVF success rates. Its emphasis on whole foods, healthy fats, and nutrient-rich ingredients appears to positively impact reproductive health and hormone balance. However, it's important to note that individual results may vary, and consulting with a medical professional before making any dietary changes is crucial, especially for couples undergoing fertility treatments.

Incorporating the Mediterranean diet into your lifestyle is not only a step toward potentially improving IVF outcomes but also a pathway to better overall health. By nourishing your body with the goodness of nature, you're not just supporting your fertility journey, but also giving yourself the best chance at a healthier and happier future.
