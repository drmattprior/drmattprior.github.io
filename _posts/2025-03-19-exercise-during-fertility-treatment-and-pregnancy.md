There are a lot of things you can do to prepare yourselves for treatment. Regular exercise will ensure you maintain a healthy weight and reduce stress.

A common question is what about during treatment and in pregnancy. Will it cause any harm? The short answer is no, it will not cause any harm. If you exercised before treatment or pregnancy continue to do what you did previously.

The Chief Medical Officer for the UK published advice in 2019 for pregnant women. Advice was that if you exercised before, keep on going. If youâ€™re not active, then start gradually. Use common sense.
