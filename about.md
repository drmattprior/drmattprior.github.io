Iâ€™m a doctor in Newcastle, and an NHS consultant. I work at Newcastle Fertility Centre at the International Centre for Life.

Reproductive medicine is my specialty. I help people with fertility problems using a holistic approach. I strive for excellence and share my passion, ideas and practices with those around me.
