### Dr Matthew Prior – Fertility and IVF Specialist in Newcastle, UK

I am a fertility and IVF specialist based in Newcastle, UK. I provide expert care for both NHS and private patients, helping individuals and couples navigate their fertility journey with compassion and evidence-based treatments. 

I see NHS fertility patients at Newcastle Fertility Centre, where I offer comprehensive assessments and advanced reproductive treatments, including IVF and egg freezing. I also provide NHS gynaecology care at the **Royal Victoria Infirmary** and **Tyneside Surgical Services**, with clinics in **Team Valley** and **Blaydon**, where I diagnose and treat a range of women’s health conditions. 

For private patients, I offer virtual and face-to-face consultations, providing tailored fertility advice, second opinions, and treatment options.

With over 20 years of experience in fertility and reproductive health, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality, patient-centred care. Whether you are struggling to conceive, exploring treatment options, or seeking specialist gynaecological advice.

I am here to provide personalised and friendly support and the latest medical treatments to help you achieve your goals.
