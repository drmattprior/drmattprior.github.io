## Newcastle Fertility Centre
I provides expert fertility care for NHS and private patients at Newcastle Fertility Centre, a leading clinic specialising in assisted reproduction. Here, patients receive comprehensive assessments, fertility investigations, and advanced treatments such as IVF and ICSI, all within a supportive and evidence-based environment. I work closely with a multidisciplinary team to ensure the highest standard of care for individuals and couples seeking NHS-funded or Private fertility treatment.

## Tyneside Surgical Services
In addition to fertility care, I sees NHS gynaecology patients at Tyneside Surgical Services, with clinics located in Team Valley and Blaydon. These clinics offer expert diagnosis and treatment for a wide range of gynaecological conditions, including menstrual disorders, endometriosis, and fibroids. Patients benefit from shorter waiting times and a patient-centred approach to womenâ€™s health.

## Private Consultations
For private patients, I offer virtual consultations as well as face-to-face appointments for those seeking tailored fertility advice, second opinions, or private treatment pathways. Whether you are exploring fertility options, considering IVF, or need specialist guidance, private consultations provide flexibility and direct access to expert care in a setting that suits your needs.
